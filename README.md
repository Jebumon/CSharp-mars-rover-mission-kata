# Mars Rover : Tech Task
The aim of this project is to build a Solution in C# by implementing the OOPs principles with well designed, extendable, readable and well tested code. This project helped me to explore and learn the various aspects of C# and .NET.
The project is about  to create a program to move Rover around the surface of Mars.

##  Representation of a Rover’s Position on the Plateau
The Plateau is divided into a grid. A Rover’s position is represented by x and y co-ordinates and the letters N, S, W, E to represent North,
South, West, East (the four cardinal compass points) respectively.

##  Special features of this project

         * I have added an additional feature to display Rover position and path on Plateau surface like a map.
         * Maximum possible Plateau size in this project is '2,147,483,647' x '2,147,483,647' so, position accuracy/reselution is very high.
         * Provision for implimenting a GUI easly in this project.
